# BMI Calculator (Vücut Kitle İndeksi Hesaplama)

A simple Python script that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight (kg) and height (m).

## How It Works

- Takes user input: weight in kilograms, height in meters
- Calculates BMI using the formula:  
  `BMI = weight / (height ** 2)`
- Displays the result rounded to 2 decimal places
- Shows BMI classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)

## Run the Program

```bash
python vki.py

Enter your weight (kg): 70  
Enter your height (m): 1.75  
Your BMI is: 22.86 (Normal)
